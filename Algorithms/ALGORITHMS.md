# Algorithms

-   Incremental Sum - function that takes a number and adds all integers up to it.
-   Frequency Counter - do something based on how many times a thing is repeated. Use cases, check if two arrays have the same number entries, or check if two works are anagrams.
-   Multiple Pointers - create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move toward the beginning, middle or end based on a certain condition.
-   Sliding window - create a "window" to handle a subset of data in a large set of data.
